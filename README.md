This repository contains the source code of **DATR** from the paper [Look at the Neighbor: Distortion-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation]().

In this paper, we find that the pixels' neighboring regions in the ERP indeed introduce less distortion. This observation unfolds the pivotal trade-off between the receptive field and distortion problems by controlling the neighboring region size. In light of this, we propose a novel UDA framework that can efficiently address the distortion problems for panoramic semantic segmentation. Compared with the state-of-the-art UDA methods, **our method is simpler, easier to implement and more computationally efficient**.
